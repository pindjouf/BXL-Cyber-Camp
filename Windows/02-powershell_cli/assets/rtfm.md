# Powershell RTFM

Powershell has the basic functionalities that bash has but it uses aliases for it.

It's very annoying syntax with unnecessarily long words and capitalization but it works.


`man` is replaced by `Get-Help`
Ex: `Get-Help ls`

By the way here are a few familiar commands and their alias in powershell:

- `ls` -> `Get-ChildItem`
- `cd` -> `Set-Location`
- `mv` -> `Move-Item`
