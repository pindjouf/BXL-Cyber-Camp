# Step By Step Documentation

I've decided to document nearly everything I'm doing and the reasoning behind it so that I can clearly see the mistakes I make, because a lot of things that are supposed to work smoothly, aren't.

- **The Domain Controller (DaMain)**
  - VM Network Config = NAT

- The Server (DaServ)
  - VM Network Config = NAT

- The Client (DaClient)
  - VM Network Config = NAT
