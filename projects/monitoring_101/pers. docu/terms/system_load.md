Having a multiple core CPU does not change what the figures mean but changes how they should be interpreted. For example, if you have a 4 core CPU, then a load of 1.0 is still equivalent to one process using 100% CPU on one core, but there are three other cores. So on a 4 core CPU, the point of maximum efficiency is 4.0, not 1.0 - and the point at which everything is running at 1/3 efficiency is 12.0, not 3.0. To add to the complexity, a single process may have more than one thread each claiming CPU of its own. So a single process can use 100% of all 4 cores if it's multi-threaded.
