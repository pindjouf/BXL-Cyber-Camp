## What I've learned/done

### üåê Networking Fundamentals

- #### Through projects like [small network](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Networkk/Small-Network).

    - **Summary:** Created a functional network using Cisco 2960 switch, three Windows 10 PCs, Cisco 1841 router, and web & DNS servers. The network topology was designed using Cisco Packet Tracer to facilitate current operations and accommodate future expansion.

- #### And [secure network design](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Networkk/secure_network_design) 

    - **Summary:** Adopted a subnetting strategy where the first usable IP in each subnet was assigned to the gateway, static IPs were reserved for permanent devices, and DHCP was used for dynamic IP assignment to workstations. Despite simulation constraints, implemented security protocols like RADIUS and TACACS+ to manage network access, ensuring robust protection and clear segmentation.

## What I'm working on

### ‚ö°SC-900

I am currently preparing for the SC-900 certification, focusing on understanding the fundamentals of Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity (SCI). This involves gaining knowledge in several key areas:

- Concepts of Security, Compliance, and Identity (SCI): Understanding the core principles and practices that underpin Microsoft's approach to protecting data and managing compliance.
- Microsoft Identity and Access Management Solutions: Learning about Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and how it provides secure access to resources.
- Microsoft Security Solutions: Exploring various security tools and solutions within Microsoft 365 and Azure, including Microsoft Defender, security management, and endpoint security.
- Microsoft Compliance Solutions: Studying how Microsoft solutions help organizations meet regulatory requirements and manage risks related to data privacy and protection.

My goal is to gain a solid understanding of these concepts to enhance my cybersecurity skillset and improve my ability to protect organizational assets using Microsoft technologies.
