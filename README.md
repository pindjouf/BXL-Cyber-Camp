# Linuxx
It's 8 PM
My project has turned into a mess.
I will restart the server from scratch.
Here's what needs to be done by Friday 00:00:

1. DHCP server (1 hour)
2. DNS server (1 hour)
3. Http + mariadb + GLPI (1 hour)
4. Weekly Config Backups (30 minutes)
5. Documentation (15 minutes)

Those estimates are probably way off but let's see. I will leave this as the main readme for the challenge and update tomorrow to see how far I've gotten.
