## What I've learned/done

### üåê Networking Fundamentals

- #### Through projects like [Small Network](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Networkk/Small-Network).

    - **Summary:** Created a functional network using Cisco 2960 switch, three Windows 10 PCs, Cisco 1841 router, and web & DNS servers. The network topology was designed using Cisco Packet Tracer to facilitate current operations and accommodate future expansion.

- #### And [Secure Network Design](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Networkk/secure_network_design) 

    - **Summary:** Adopted a subnetting strategy where the first usable IP in each subnet was assigned to the gateway, static IPs were reserved for permanent devices, and DHCP was used for dynamic IP assignment to workstations. Despite simulation constraints, implemented security protocols like RADIUS and TACACS+ to manage network access, ensuring robust protection and clear segmentation.
### üêß Linux

- #### Through projects like [Client-Server Architecture](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Linuxx/projects/linux_client_server_project).

    - **Summary:** Where I learned about the classic client-server architecture by setting up a Linux server and a workstation. The server, without a GUI, was configured to run essential services including DHCP (isc-dhcp-server) for automatic IP addressing, DNS (bind) for resolving internal resources and redirecting external ones, and HTTP + MariaDB + GLPI for web-based IT management. I implemented weekly backups of configuration files into a single compressed archive and enabled SSH for remote management. Optionally, backups were stored on a separate disk partition, mounted only during the backup process.
    
        The workstation, running a desktop environment, was equipped with applications such as LibreOffice, Gimp, and Mullvad browser. It was set up to use DHCP for automatic IP addressing and had its /home folder on a separate partition on the same disk. Additionally, I proposed and implemented a solution for remote user assistance.
    
        This project provided practical experience in configuring and managing a client-server architecture, ensuring efficient service delivery and robust management practices. P.S. I am far from being done with the official project but have implemented some of the learnings into some of my personal ones like in [media pirate stack](https://github.com/pindjouf/mediapiratestack). Where I've set up a similar [monitoring script](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Linuxx/projects/el_doctor) and a simple web server.

- #### [Monitoring 101](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Linuxx/projects/monitoring_101)

    - **Summary:** In the Monitoring 101 project, I learned the essential aspects of monitoring a Linux system to ensure service availability, reliability, and security. The project involved both theoretical research and practical application.
    
        - Collected and analyzed data on the system‚Äôs state, focusing on the most relevant metrics.
   
        - Generated reports detailing the current health and performance of the machine, including CPU, memory, disk usage, network traffic, and user activities.
   
        - Emphasized proactive monitoring to troubleshoot and understand errors, aiming to prevent issues before they occur.

        - This project provided comprehensive insights into system monitoring, enabling me to maintain optimal performance, identify and resolve issues, and ensure the security and reliability of Linux systems.

## What I'm working on

### ‚ö°SC-900

I am currently preparing for the SC-900 certification, focusing on understanding the fundamentals of Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity (SCI). This involves gaining knowledge in several key areas:

- Concepts of Security, Compliance, and Identity (SCI): Understanding the core principles and practices that underpin Microsoft's approach to protecting data and managing compliance.
- Microsoft Identity and Access Management Solutions: Learning about Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and how it provides secure access to resources.
- Microsoft Security Solutions: Exploring various security tools and solutions within Microsoft 365 and Azure, including Microsoft Defender, security management, and endpoint security.
- Microsoft Compliance Solutions: Studying how Microsoft solutions help organizations meet regulatory requirements and manage risks related to data privacy and protection.

My goal is to gain a solid understanding of these concepts to enhance my cybersecurity skillset and improve my ability to protect organizational assets using Microsoft technologies.
