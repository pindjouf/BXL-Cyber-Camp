# Linuxx
It's 8 PM \
My project has turned into a mess. \
I will restart the server from scratch. \
Here's what needs to be done by Friday 00:00 and the time I'm giving myself to do them:

1. DHCP server (1 hour) [docs](https://github.com/pindjouf/Linuxx/blob/main/projects/linux_client_server_project/pers.%20docu/server/making_a_dhcp_server.md)
2. DNS server (1 hour) [docs](https://github.com/pindjouf/Linuxx/blob/main/projects/linux_client_server_project/pers.%20docu/server/dns/)
3. Http + mariadb + GLPI (1 hour) [docs](https://github.com/pindjouf/Linuxx/blob/main/projects/linux_client_server_project/pers.%20docu/server/making_an_http_server.md)
4. Weekly Config Backups (30 minutes)
5. Documentation (15 minutes)

Those estimates are probably way off but let's see. I will leave this as the main readme for the challenge and update tomorrow to see how far I've gotten.
