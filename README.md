## What I've learned/done

### üåê Networking Fundamentals

- #### Through projects like [Small Network](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Networkk/Small-Network)

    - **Summary:** Created a functional network using Cisco 2960 switch, three Windows 10 PCs, Cisco 1841 router, and web & DNS servers. The network topology was designed using Cisco Packet Tracer to facilitate current operations and accommodate future expansion.

- #### And [Secure Network Design](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Networkk/secure_network_design)

    - **Summary:** Adopted a subnetting strategy where the first usable IP in each subnet was assigned to the gateway, static IPs were reserved for permanent devices, and DHCP was used for dynamic IP assignment to workstations. Despite simulation constraints, implemented security protocols like RADIUS and TACACS+ to manage network access, ensuring robust protection and clear segmentation.

### üêß Linux

- #### Through projects like [Client-Server Architecture](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Linuxx/projects/linux_client_server_project)

    - **Summary:** Where I learned about the classic client-server architecture by setting up a Linux server and a workstation. The server, without a GUI, was configured to run essential services including DHCP (isc-dhcp-server) for automatic IP addressing, DNS (bind) for resolving internal resources and redirecting external ones, and HTTP + MariaDB + GLPI for web-based IT management. I implemented weekly backups of configuration files into a single compressed archive and enabled SSH for remote management.

- #### And [Monitoring 101](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Linuxx/projects/monitoring_101)

    - **Summary:** In the Monitoring 101 project, I learned the essential aspects of monitoring a Linux system to ensure service availability, reliability, and security. The project involved both theoretical research and practical application.

### ü™ü Windows

- #### Through projects like [Windows Server AD](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Windowss/03-AD)

    - This project involved setting up a Windows Server Active Directory environment, promoting a Domain Controller VM, creating a new domain structure, configuring DNS, and joining VMs to the domain. I managed user accounts for Alice and Bob,I also configured IIS for Alice‚Äôs web app and verified DNS functionality.

### üé£ Phishing

- #### Through reports like [these](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Phishingg/reports)

    - In this project, I gained valuable skills in identifying phishing attempts and understanding phishing tactics through hands-on experience.

    - I learned to analyze `.eml` files to detect signs of phishing, such as suspicious email addresses, misleading links, and anomalies in email headers. Additionally, I developed the ability to write comprehensive reports detailing the findings from these analyses, highlighting red flags and providing recommendations for handling potential phishing emails.

- #### And my [campaign](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Phishingg/campaign)

    - I also created a phishing campaign to understand how attackers operate. This involved developing a fake Amazon login page and crafting a convincing email designed to appear as though it came from Amazon. By using personalized data to tailor the email content, I learned how attackers increase the effectiveness of their phishing attempts.

    - Through this project, I enhanced my ability to recognize, report, and defend against phishing attacks, gaining insights into both detection and prevention strategies.

### üíª Programming

- #### Through projects like [hackers_poulette](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Programmingg/projects/flask)

    - This project involved creating a backend solution for a company called Hackers Poulette‚Ñ¢. This project not only enhanced my coding abilities but also deepened my understanding of web security practices.

- #### And [hostel scraper](https://github.com/pindjouf/BXL-Cyber-Camp/tree/main/Programmingg/projects/scraper)

    - A Python script to scrape hostel prices from Hostelworld, storing the data in MongoDB. Using Selenium, I automated data collection for hostel names, links, and prices, with updates logged for changes. This project enhanced my skills in automation, web scraping, and database management.


### üö© CTF(s)

I also participated in several Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. One of the most significant challenges was the CTF I completed for admission to the Cyber Summer School organized by the Belgian Cyber Command. This challenge tested my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills across a variety of cybersecurity domains.

You can find more details about this specific challenge and my approach in the dedicated repository [here](https://github.com/pindjouf/cyber_summer_school_application).

## üë®‚Äçüíª What I'm working on

- ### ‚õìÔ∏è [Cryptoooor](https://cryptoooor.com)

I'm actively developing *cryptoooor*, a file encryption web app and CLI written in Rust and WebAssembly. This project allows users to securely encrypt their files with ease, both from the browser and command line, providing a robust solution for modern file security needs.

- ### üîß [*From the Transistor to the Web Browser*](https://github.com/pindjouf/fromthetransistor)

I'm also working on the *From the Transistor to the Web Browser* course, where I'm learning the modern computer stack from first principles. This journey involves building components like a UART, CPU and more, helping me gain a deeper understanding of how computers work at a fundamental level.

- ### üìù [Kof](https://github.com/pindjouf/kof)

In addition, I'm developing Kof, a terminal-based, Git-powered note management system designed to help users reorganize their thoughts through writing. It provides features like creating and managing notes, as well as a search function to quickly locate specific notes. I also plan to implement a syncing feature to allow users to sync their notes across devices.
